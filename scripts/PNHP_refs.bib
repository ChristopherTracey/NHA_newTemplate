This publication serves as an introduction to seasonal pool ecology and management; it also provides tools for exploring seasonal pools, including a full-color ﬁeld guide to wildlife. Seasonal pools are deﬁned as having four distinctive features: surface water isolation, periodic drying, small size and shallow depth, and support of a characteristic biological community. Seasonal pools experience regular drying that excludes populations of predatory ﬁsh. Thus, pools in the mid-Atlantic region provide critical breeding habitat for amphibian and invertebrate species (e.g., spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), wood frog (Rana sylvatica), and fairy shrimp (Order Anostraca)) that would be at increased risk of predation in more permanent waters.},

Fire, which has historically played an important role in defining the prairie landscape, may also play some role in breaking dormancy by producing a variety of biologically active smoke substances. The role of smoke as a germination cue was investigated in this study, during which the ex situ germination of 37 prairie species was measured in response to aerosol smoke treatment. Overall, one third of the species responded positively, while others were either inhibited or exhibited no response at all. Smoke may therefore play a more significant role in maintaining the composition and structure of tallgrass prairie communities than was previously realized.},

	abstract = {The United States has a total land area of about 2.3 billion acres. In 2012, the major land uses were grassland pasture and rangeland at 655 million acres (29 percent of U.S. total); forest-use land at 632 million (28 percent); cropland at 392 million acres (17 percent); special uses (primarily parks and wildlife areas) at 316 million acres (14 percent); miscellaneous uses (such as wetlands, tundra, and unproductive woodlands) at 196 million acres (9 percent); and urban land at 70 million acres (3 percent). This study presents findings from the most recent (2012) inventory of U.S. major land uses, drawing on data from USDA, the U.S. Census Bureau, public land management and conservation agencies, and other sources. The data are collected for each State to estimate the use of several broad classes and subclasses of agricultural and nonagricultural land over time. National and regional trends in land use are compared with earlier major land-use estimates.},

	abstract = {Using aerial photograph interpretation of circa 2005 imagery, percent tree canopy and impervious surface cover in the conterminous United States are estimated at 34.2\% (standard error (SE) = 0.2\%) and 2.4\% (SE = 0.1\%), respectively. Within urban/community areas, percent tree cover (35.1\%, SE = 0.4\%) is similar to the national value, but percent impervious cover is signiﬁcantly higher (17.5\%, SE = 0.3\%). Tree cover per capita in urban areas averaged 377 m2/person, while impervious cover per capita averaged 274 m2/person. Percent tree cover in urban/community areas tends to be signiﬁcantly higher than in rural areas in several predominantly grassland states, with the greatest difference in Kansas (+17.3\%). Most states in more forested regions exhibited a decrease in tree cover between urban/community areas and rural lands, with greatest difference in Kentucky (−37.9\%). These changes in tree cover varied signiﬁcantly among states, illustrating the roles of urban development patterns, management/planning interactions, and the natural environment on creating cover patterns exhibited in urban areas. Understanding these forces and patterns can lead to better planning and management activities to optimize the mix of tree and impervious cover to sustain urban functions while enhancing environmental quality and human health in urban areas.},
